# Password

Introducing a straightforward app designed for managing usernames and passwords. Developed as part of my HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) course project, this app ensures secure access with valid usernames and passwords.

Created using Swift on Xcode, the app features a simple login screen where users can input their username and password. However, during screen recording, the security feature provided by Swift, which masks the password for privacy, isn't visible in the video demonstration below. Nonetheless, rest assured that the app maintains privacy and security standards to protect your login credentials.
